# CAN_NETWORK
Implementation of CAN communication between two Hercules Safety MCUs - TMS570LS1224 and TMS570LS1227. Interrupts were employed on each node to notify succesful transmission and reception of messages on the CAN network. 

The Loop-back folder was used during debugging to check if the CAN module of each NODE was functional - this helped in eliminating the nodes as source of errors in the CAN network.
